Export data for external analysis and reporting.\n\n-- Step 1: Create the Database\nCREATE DATABASE LibraryDB;\n\\c LibraryDB;  -- Connect to the newly created database\n\n-- Step 2: Create Tables with Constraints\n\n-- Books Table: Stores information about books in the library.\nCREATE TABLE Books (\n    BookID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,           -- Unique identifier for each book.\n    Title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,         -- Title of the book (cannot be null).\n    Author VARCHAR(100),                 -- Author of the book.\n    Genre VARCHAR(50),                   -- Genre of the book.\n    Copies INT CHECK (Copies >= 0)       -- Number of copies available (must be >= 0).\n);\n\n-- Members Table: Stores information about library members.\nCREATE TABLE Members (\n    MemberID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,         -- Unique identifier for each member.\n    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,          -- Name of the member (cannot be null).\n    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,  -- Email address (must be unique).\n    JoinDate DATE NOT NULL               -- Date the member joined the library.\n);\n\n-- Borrowed_Books Table: Records the books borrowed by members.\nCREATE TABLE Borrowed_Books (\n    BorrowID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,         -- Unique identifier for each borrowing transaction.\n    MemberID INT,                        -- Foreign key referencing the member who borrowed the book.\n    BookID INT,                          -- Foreign key referencing the book borrowed.\n    BorrowDate DATE NOT NULL,            -- Date the book was borrowed.\n    ReturnDate DATE,                     -- Date the book was returned (can be null if not returned).\n    FOREIGN KEY (MemberID) REFERENCES Members(MemberID),  -- Foreign key constraint on MemberID.\n    FOREIGN KEY (BookID) REFERENCES Books(BookID)         -- Foreign key constraint on BookID.\n);\n\n-- Step 3: Insert Sample Data\n-- Explanation: Sample data is added to the tables to simulate real-world scenarios, allowing us to test the database functionality effectively.\n\n-- Insert Books: Adding a few books to the library.\nINSERT INTO Books (Title, Author, Genre, Copies)\nVALUES\n('1984', 'George Orwell', 'Dystopian', 5),\n('To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Harper Lee', 'Fiction', 3),\n('The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', 'Classic', 4);\n\n-- Insert Members: Adding a few members to the library.\nINSERT INTO Members (Name, Email, JoinDate)\nVALUES\n('Alice Johnson', 'alice@example.com', '2024-01-10'),\n('Bob Smith', 'bob@example.com', '2024-02-15');\n\n-- Insert Borrowed_Books: Adding a few borrowing records.\nINSERT INTO Borrowed_Books (MemberID, BookID, BorrowDate, ReturnDate)\nVALUES\n(1, 1, '2024-12-20', NULL),\n(2, 2, '2024-12-22', '2024-12-25');\n\n-- Step 4: Create Triggers for Automation\n-- Explanation: Triggers are used to automate the update of book availability when borrowing or returning occurs, ensuring accurate data management.\n\n-- Trigger to Decrease Copies When a Book is Borrowed\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION DecreaseCopies() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$\nBEGIN\n    UPDATE Books\n    SET Copies = Copies - 1\n    WHERE BookID = NEW.BookID AND Copies > 0;  -- Only decrease if copies > 0\n    RETURN NEW;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\n-- Create the Trigger for DecreaseCopies function.\nCREATE TRIGGER DecreaseCopiesTrigger\nAFTER INSERT ON Borrowed_Books\nFOR EACH ROW\nEXECUTE FUNCTION DecreaseCopies();\n\n-- Trigger to Increase Copies When a Book is Returned\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION IncreaseCopies() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$\nBEGIN\n    IF NEW.ReturnDate IS NOT NULL THEN\n        UPDATE Books\n        SET Copies = Copies + 1\n        WHERE BookID = NEW.BookID;  -- Increase copies when book is returned\n    END IF;\n    RETURN NEW;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\n-- Create the Trigger for IncreaseCopies function.\nCREATE TRIGGER IncreaseCopiesTrigger\nAFTER UPDATE ON Borrowed_Books\nFOR EACH ROW\nEXECUTE FUNCTION IncreaseCopies();\n\n-- Step 5: Useful Queries\n-- Explanation: These queries are designed to retrieve actionable insights from the database, such as viewing all books, listing borrowed books, and identifying overdue records.\n\n-- View All Books: Displays all books in the library.\nSELECT * FROM Books;\n\n-- List Members Who Borrowed Books: Shows which members have borrowed which books.\nSELECT Members.Name, Books.Title, Borrowed_Books.BorrowDate, Borrowed_Books.ReturnDate\nFROM Borrowed_Books\nJOIN Members ON Borrowed_Books.MemberID = Members.MemberID\nJOIN Books ON Borrowed_Books.BookID = Books.BookID;\n\n-- Check Available Copies of a Book: Shows the number of available copies of a specific book.\nSELECT Title, Copies\nFROM Books\nWHERE Title = '1984';\n\n-- Add a New Borrowing Record: Adds a new record when a member borrows a book.\nINSERT INTO Borrowed_Books (MemberID, BookID, BorrowDate, ReturnDate)\nVALUES (1, 3, '2024-12-26', NULL);\n\n-- Update Return Date for a Borrowed Book: Updates the return date for a borrowed book.\nUPDATE Borrowed_Books\nSET ReturnDate = '2024-12-30'\nWHERE BorrowID = 1;\n\n-- Delete a Member: Deletes a member from the system.\nDELETE FROM Members\nWHERE MemberID = 2;\n\n-- Find the Most Borrowed Book: Identifies the book that has been borrowed the most.\nSELECT Books.Title, COUNT(Borrowed_Books.BookID) AS BorrowCount\nFROM Borrowed_Books\nJOIN Books ON Borrowed_Books.BookID = Books.BookID\nGROUP BY Books.Title\nORDER BY BorrowCount DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n\n-- List Overdue Books: Displays books that have been borrowed but not returned within the last 14 days.\nSELECT Members.Name, Books.Title, Borrowed_Books.BorrowDate, Borrowed_Books.ReturnDate\nFROM Borrowed_Books\nJOIN Members ON Borrowed_Books.MemberID = Members.MemberID\nJOIN Books ON Borrowed_Books.BookID = Books.BookID\nWHERE Borrowed_Books.ReturnDate IS NULL AND Borrowed_Books.BorrowDate < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '14 days';","executedQueryParameters":[]}}],"execution_count":2},{"source":"","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"df1","sqlCellMode":"dataFrame","sqlSource":{"integrationId":"4000eaff-e663-4eef-88d8-4260bab6c43b","integrationType":"postgresql","type":"integration"}},"cell_type":"code","id":"bfaab193-8bed-42a8-a38a-9b65681cd0ae","outputs":[],"execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
